# HangMan
A small Hangman game, written in Java.

I had fun making this game, the most challenging part of it was implementing a game reset when option for when you win or failed. I feel i learnt a lot
during this project and definitely improved my confidence in writing in Java.

If i had more time to work on it i would have added a REGEX to only allow text letters, currently numbers and punctuation/symbols can be input but will do 
nothing but waste a life. I would also look at restricting input to just one character at a time, currently putting more than one character into the input
field is possible but it will only check the first letter of the input string against the word.

Other than these two minor points i think the outcome of this project was great!
